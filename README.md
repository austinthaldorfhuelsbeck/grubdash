# GrubDash: Postgres Project

## A RESTful API designed using Express and Postgres.

### Synopsis

This project provided the opportunity to think through REST structure and translate that into JavaScript using powerful backend libraries.

### Challenges

One key challenge of this project was its test-driven nature. The server structure was straightforward and laid out well, and I found myself with a rough draft quickly. Revising the solution until all tests passed proved much more difficult.

Another challenge unique to this project is the amount of file structure organization and command-line actions required. Compared to a React app, I found myself typing less code but pausing to think more often.

### Modularity

At this point in the cirriculum, I have not learned as much about creating modular, DRY code as I will learn.

However, I challenged myself to make this project as concise and modular as possible with the tools I had. I also made an effort not to repeat myself where possible.
